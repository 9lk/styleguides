A Yeoman generator for Pattern Lab, a static site generator based on Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodologies. Yeo+Lab scaffolds out a new Pattern Lab site (using default or custom patterns) and sets up a few other optional workflow bells and whistles (Compass, Sass, Bower, Grunt) and front-end dependencies (jQuery, Modernizr, Require, etc.).
