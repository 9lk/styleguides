Dave Rupert introduces the need to deliver "tiny Bootstraps for every client". "Instead of delivering one PSD per page or worse, one PSD per responsive view, we should be thinking about deliverables as modular pieces of the larger system. Whether theyâ€™re based on strategy, components, or layout, they should all be built with extendibility in mind."
