Style guides often seem like a lot of work, why would you want to bother doing one? A style guide can increase performance of your site, the quickness with which you can add on new features and sections to your site or application, and it's great documentation for new team members to get up-to-speed. In this session we'll take a look at the benefits of creating and maintaining a style guide. In addition, we'll take a look at a few different case studies of style guides; how to create them, how they were useful in cutting code, and how they were used to do design changes quickly.
